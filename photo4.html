            <p>Our first meeting after almost a year of being in a long-distance relationship felt so surreal. After all the waiting, late-night calls, and missing each other, finally being together again made everything worth it. Seeing you in person, hearing your laugh right next to me, and holding your hand after so long—it was a moment I’ll never forget. This photo captures that happiness, and I’ll always cherish it.</p>
