            <p>The first time I cooked for you, I made your favoriteâ€”sisig tofu. I wanted it to be perfect because it meant so much to me to see you enjoy something I made. Watching you take the first bite and seeing your reaction made me so happy. It was a simple moment, but one I'll always cherish.</p>
