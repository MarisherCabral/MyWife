            <p>July 22 â€“ Our first monthsary together in person! It wasnâ€™t as perfect as I had planned (thanks to the ramen accident ðŸ˜‚), but that just made it even more unforgettable. Despite the little mishap, what truly mattered was that we were together, sharing laughs and making memories. I wouldn't have it any other way!</p>
