            <p>This photo is the last one we took together before you left for Hungary, marking the start of our long-distance relationship again. It's bittersweet, but I’ll always cherish this moment as we create new memories across the miles. Even though distance separates us, our connection is as strong as ever. I can't wait for the next time we’re together again.</p>
